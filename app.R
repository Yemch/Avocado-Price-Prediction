                      Over the past 40 years, per capita avocado consumption more than quadrupled from 1.7 pounds to 8.0 pounds in 2018, 
                      surpassing all other fresh fruit sales in the US over this period (Carman HF, 2018). 
                      The US primarily imports avocados from international suppliers to meet elevated demand, 
                      which has benefited domestic producers through more competitive pricing (US Department of Agriculture, 2020).

                    individuals in certain areas may not be able to incorporate avocados into their diets. 
                    We propose a US county-level descriptive analysis of avocado prices in comparison with food environment characteristics, 
                    such as median household income, proximity to grocery store, and grocery store availability. 
                    We also use these and related variables to predict avocado prices in California, 
                    a large US state with a diverse range of food environments. Our goal is to use this algorithm to predict avocado prices in other regions of the US to
